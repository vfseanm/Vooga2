/**
 * A BorderSidescroller allows for normal sidescrolling. There are four subclasses, one for each direction -
 * up, down, left, and right. In the game, the character will move freely without moving the level in any
 * direction unless the character touches the border created by any of the BorderSidescrollers. If it crosses
 * this border, the level will move in the direction the fighter crossed the border in by moving all object
 * but the Fighter in the opposite direction.
